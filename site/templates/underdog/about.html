                <h3>Objective:</h3>
                <p class="sif-subtext">
                    Each week you make 5 picks: 4 Upsets and 1 Upset Special. If your Upset pick (the underdog) wins outright, you earn points for picking the upset correctly.
                    The number of points awarded is based on the ESPN closing line (http://www.espn.com/college-football/scoreboard/_/group/80/year/2017/seasontype/2/week/1) for the game.
                    Should an ESPN closing line not be available, we will use the Oddsshark line (oddsshark.com/ncaaf/odds).
                    The person with the most points at the end of the bowl season is the winner.

                <h3>Scoring:</h3>
                <p class="sif-subtext">
                If you pick a game where a team is favored by 6 points and the underdog wins outright, you get 6 points.
                If the favorite was favored by 11 points, and the underdog wins outright, you get 11 points, etc.
                If the underdog does not win, no sweat, but you don’t get any points.
                If your Upset Special pick comes in you get double the value of the upset.
                That 6 point underdog is now worth 12 points if it wins.

                <h3>Picks:</h3>
                <p>
                1. What games can I choose from?<br>
                <span class="sif-subtext">Any game involving an FBS team that has an ESPN or OddsShark spread/line.
                This includes games where an FBS team is playing an FCS team (assuming an ESPN/OddsShark spread is present).
                If there is no closing spread in either OddsShark or ESPN, no points will be awarded.</span>
                <br><br>

                2. When are picks due?<br>
                <span class="sif-subtext">You do not need to make all 5 of your picks at once, but all individual picks are due by the start time of the game.
                To ensure your pick is in place in time, submit in advance.</span>
                <br><br>

                3. Can I change my picks once submitted?<br>
                <span class="sif-subtext">Yes, individual picks can be changed up until gametime.
                Once a “picked” game reaches gametime, it becomes locked and is one of your picks.
                Once locked it can no longer be changed.</span>
                <br><br>

                4. Help with picking lines?<br>

                <h3>Frequently Asked:</h3>
                <p>
                    1. How many weeks in the season?<br>
                    <span class="sif-subtext">You will be picking 15 total “weeks” - 14 weeks + the bowl season.</span>
                    <br><br>

                    2. What line/spread is used?<br>
                    <span class="sif-subtext">The ESPN closing line is used when available.
                    If not available, or if incorrect, the OddsShark line is what is used.
                    If the point spread when you picked a game is 5, but it changes to 2 by kickoff, the closing line at kick-off is what is used for scoring.</span>
                    <br><br>

                    3. What if the line changes and my underdog is no longer an underdog?<br>
                    <span class="sif-subtext">Your pick is always for the underdog in the game, it is not tied to a specific team.
                    Therefore, if the line changes, and a favorite becomes the underdog...you're now going to want to root for the "new" underdog.</span>
